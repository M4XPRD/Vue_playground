## Description:
This is a test Vue3 learning project. I've tested how Vue3 works by some manuals and videos. 

## Features:
- It fetches 100 JSON placeholder's posts
- You can filter posts by name or by description
- You can find specific posts using search bar
- The same functionality works with vanilla Vue3, with Vuex and with Composition API
- It's made for learning Vu3 only, so it's not polished like it's made for production
